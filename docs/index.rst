SQL Adapter
===========

**SQL Adapter** is a powerful ORM for adapting Java objects into SQL and back
again. It is heavily inspired by `ActiveModel`_ from Ruby on Rails, but still
maintains its own identity, and feels at home within the Java ecosystem.

The original version of this library was thrown together very quickly for a
university assignment by `Sean Bailey`_.

Features
--------

 - Save, query, or delete models with a single line.
 - Chain SQL functions together for more control over your queries.
 - Automatically infers information such as table names, column names, and more.
 - Highly configurable.
